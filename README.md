# rpi-setup

These are the commands to setup a fresh raspi, designed for raspbian lite.

WIRELESS SERVER
- You'll need to install hostapd and dnsmasq then use the relevant configs in /etc
- There is a script to switch the wireless server on and off
- With newer versions of raspbian (bookworm+) you'll need to make some edits to the enable/disable script, noted inside the files
